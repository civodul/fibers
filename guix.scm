    (description
     "Fibers is a Guile library that implements a a lightweight concurrency
facility, inspired by systems like Concurrent ML, Go, and Erlang.  A fiber is
like a \"goroutine\" from the Go language: a lightweight thread-like
abstraction.  Systems built with Fibers can scale up to millions of concurrent
fibers, tens of thousands of concurrent socket connections, and many parallel
cores.  The Fibers library also provides Concurrent ML-like channels for
communication between fibers.

Note that Fibers makes use of some Guile 2.1/2.2-specific features and
is not available for Guile 2.0.")
